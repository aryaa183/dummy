# Accident-Risk-Prediction-System

A machine learning–powered system that predicts accident risk levels for a given route based on traffic, environmental, and historical accident datasets. This project integrates ML models (XGBoost, Random Forest, LSTM optional), Apriori association rule mining, and a web interface for real-time user interaction.

📌 Project Overview

The Smart Accident Risk Predictor analyzes multiple risk factors and predicts whether a given set of route conditions falls into Low, Medium, or High risk categories. It also provides:

Route-based risk scoring

Association rule insights using Apriori

Optimized model predictions

Emergency contact integration

Support for multiple datasets (big accident risk dataset for India)
